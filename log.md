# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 16, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**: Began Dart tutorials via Code With Andrea 

**Thoughts:** I already began "learning" Flutter and Dart a week or so prior to beginning this project. I am glad I updated my RAM and SSD for my laptop and install all of the packages as well. I find that Coding With Andrea as a pretty helpful guide to learn the basics of Dart language.

### Day 2: July 17, 2021
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Continued Coding With Andrea's Dart Beginners Course

**Thoughts**: I learned how to make a simple rock/paper/scissors game and definitely noticed the syntax differences between Dart and and Python. I really need to get my vscode to run properly -_____-

### Day 3: July 18, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**: Continued Dart tutorials 

**Thoughts:** More tutorials, more fundamentals. It's ok because I have to somewhat unlearn what I know in Python. Remember to add semi-colons.

### Day 7: July 22, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**:Began a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts:** I wanted to change things up, it's only been a week since I started the challenge, but wanted to take on a small project. I had to find the correct version since Dart/Flutter is constantly changing. A little bit stressful because I had to redo the entire code, but I got things started.

### Day 8: July 23, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** :Continued a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts**: Following the how-to videos is really helping me identify errors/bugs in my code. There are some things I wish I could ask the content creator directly, but I will have to research it independently for the time being.

### Day 9: July 24, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Finished DEVSPOT's weather app tutorial!!!

**Thoughts**: OMFG COMPLETED!!!!! Found some bugs/errors in my code that stopped me from running. But omg, it feels great to finish it and play around with vscode's/flutter's hot reloading feature. Definitley going to clone this codebase and use it to play around with it some more in the future. Also, started super late lol.

### Day 10: July 25, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Back on the tutorials, this time we moved away from DartPad and onto VSCode, which is great because I am know understanding it in a coding environment. The topic is regardin advanced classes. So the meat and potatoes of how classes behave in Dart/Flutter.

### Day 11: July 26, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Today was a serious case of the Mondays, plus a lot of outside distractions kept it hard to focus and concentrate. I did watch a video earlier today called 'Just Build It' by ForestKnight(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L9Ls2gIHts). It was a video essay with advice on how to begin an app project. I'll make that my weekend focus since weekends I don't feel too constrained on time. I'll do better tomorrow.

### Day 12: July 27, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Worked through another tutorial of everything classes with Dart. Completed that section, I do plan on going back and doing some more classes practices. I should get a book, since it seems to help me graps to conecpt better for when I did this with Python.

### Day 13: July 28, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: This time was a mini project on creating an ecommerce site. That was seriously a lot to digest but it was cool with learning how each class talks to each other and how to have your main method produce all of the data from the classes.

### Day 14: July 29, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Somewhat short section, learned about Mixins and Extensions for Dart. I spent like 20 minutes just playing around with initalizing classes and instantiating them in the main method. Still trying to grasp the concept of classes and all of the meat and potatoes of object-oriented programming. I was not fully there mentally since there were some outside distractions. But tomorrow's learning will be better than todays.

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: So excited, completed my first exercise without having drawing a blank. It felt great completing it, yes it was slightly different code then the solution, but got the same result! I am excited for starting tomorrow.
