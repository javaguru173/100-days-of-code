### Day 1: July 16, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**: Began Dart tutorials via Code With Andrea 

**Thoughts:** I already began "learning" Flutter and Dart a week or so prior to beginning this project. I am glad I updated my RAM and SSD for my laptop and install all of the packages as well. I find that Coding With Andrea as a pretty helpful guide to learn the basics of Dart language.

### Day 7: July 22, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**:Began a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts:** I wanted to change things up, it's only been a week since I started the challenge, but wanted to take on a small project. I had to find the correct version since Dart/Flutter is constantly changing. A little bit stressful because I had to redo the entire code, but I got things started.

### Day 8: July 23, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** :Continued a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts**: Following the how-to videos is really helping me identify errors/bugs in my code. There are some things I wish I could ask the content creator directly, but I will have to research it independently for the time being.

**Today's Progress** : Finished DEVSPOT's weather app tutorial!!!

**Thoughts**: OMFG COMPLETED!!!!! Found some bugs/errors in my code that stopped me from running. But omg, it feels great to finish it and play around with vscode's/flutter's hot reloading feature. Definitley going to clone this codebase and use it to play around with it some more in the future. Also, started super late lol.

### Day 10: July 25, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Back on the tutorials, this time we moved away from DartPad and onto VSCode, which is great because I am know understanding it in a coding environment. The topic is regardin advanced classes. So the meat and potatoes of how classes behave in Dart/Flutter.

### Day 11: July 26, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Today was a serious case of the Mondays, plus a lot of outside distractions kept it hard to focus and concentrate. I did watch a video earlier today called 'Just Build It' by ForestKnight(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L9Ls2gIHts). It was a video essay with advice on how to begin an app project. I'll make that my weekend focus since weekends I don't feel too constrained on time. I'll do better tomorrow.

##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Worked through another tutorial of everything classes with Dart. Completed that section, I do plan on going back and doing some more classes practices. I should get a book, since it seems to help me graps to conecpt better for when I did this with Python.

### Day 13: July 28, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: This time was a mini project on creating an ecommerce site. That was seriously a lot to digest but it was cool with learning how each class talks to each other and how to have your main method produce all of the data from the classes.

### Day 14: July 29, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Somewhat short section, learned about Mixins and Extensions for Dart. I spent like 20 minutes just playing around with initalizing classes and instantiating them in the main method. Still trying to grasp the concept of classes and all of the meat and potatoes of object-oriented programming. I was not fully there mentally since there were some outside distractions. But tomorrow's learning will be better than todays.

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: So I finished the rest of my troubleshooting. Turns out I had not only a BIOS update, but the 21H1 and a .NET OS update for my machine. Luckily I had a spare macbook that had VSCode and Flutter installed(but not XCode apparently). Oh well, today was a better day than yesterday, I'm almost dobe with the Dart tutorials for Coding with Andrea.

### Day 19: Aug 03, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Played around in VSCode while watching some Flutter basics on Google I/o

**Thoughts**: It started with watching some really really remidial videos on youtube about Flutter(widgets), and I took it upon myself to create another project and kept it simple. By simple, its a basic app that has a list of plants I own. I have an idea on how I want it to look and feel so this will be my first true project. I began googling all types of widgets and how to call them in my code. Only created about 10 lines of code, but I am comprehending this a lot better now.

### Day 20: Aug 04, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued to work on my test app in VSCode

**Thoughts**: Began playing around with Stateless Widgets and add building widgets inside each other and figuring out when to place a new child widget vs children, and proper syntax for each widget. Defintley helping because I am envisioning what I want my app to do, and researching how to bring it to life.

### Day 24: Aug 07, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued widgets ui tutorial

### Day 24: Aug 08, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Started a new Flutter project!

**Thoughts**: I felt lost since I do not know exactly where to start. I keep hearing, ". . . your next step on start a project!". Ok, but how? I feel a lot of these sites give a command but not a how to go with it. I guess this is apart of the experience when learning about coding and whatnot.

### Day 25: Aug 09, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued the StartUp Name project

**Thoughts**: I first started troubleshoting my VSCode since I am still unable to launch apps within an Android emulator. I also need to install an iOS one as well. I think tomorrow I'll take a swing at that. I did try some of the suggestions I read on StackOverflow. After some attempts, no luck. I did continue the name generator project.

### Day 26: Aug 10, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Experimented with the FloatingActionButton

**Thoughts**: So I completed the tutorial, now I am playing around with the code. I found a section in my code block that I wanted to work on, which was the second page that showed the list of names that the user selected. I began researching on what FAB can and cannot do and how to customize it.

### Day 28: Aug 12, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Began working on my first project app

**Thoughts**: I used what I learned about a floatingActionButton and slowly began to make pseudo-code for my app. I think it's best to start working on each "screen" one at a time.

##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Worked on login page for app

**Thoughts**: I found a website that shows me how to construct a login page. I know for my first app its going to be a simple plant collection that saves user data based off their login credentials. But I'm feeling pretty demotiavted today, idk if it's the heat or other stuff. I just can't seem to focus and concentrate on this right now.

I did change the logo to reflect the theme of the plant app. Finally, I added some pseudo code for tomorrow with a couple things to do with regards to what I want each button to do. I think I will work on the signup page tomorrow.
