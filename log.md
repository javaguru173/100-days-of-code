# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 16, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**: Began Dart tutorials via Code With Andrea 

**Thoughts:** I already began "learning" Flutter and Dart a week or so prior to beginning this project. I am glad I updated my RAM and SSD for my laptop and install all of the packages as well. I find that Coding With Andrea as a pretty helpful guide to learn the basics of Dart language.

**Today's Progress**: Continued Dart tutorials 

**Thoughts:** More tutorials, more fundamentals. It's ok because I have to somewhat unlearn what I know in Python. Remember to add semi-colons.

### Day 7: July 22, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**:Began a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts:** I wanted to change things up, it's only been a week since I started the challenge, but wanted to take on a small project. I had to find the correct version since Dart/Flutter is constantly changing. A little bit stressful because I had to redo the entire code, but I got things started.
