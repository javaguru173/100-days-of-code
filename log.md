# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 16, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**: Began Dart tutorials via Code With Andrea 

**Thoughts:** I already began "learning" Flutter and Dart a week or so prior to beginning this project. I am glad I updated my RAM and SSD for my laptop and install all of the packages as well. I find that Coding With Andrea as a pretty helpful guide to learn the basics of Dart language.

### Day 7: July 22, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress**:Began a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts:** I wanted to change things up, it's only been a week since I started the challenge, but wanted to take on a small project. I had to find the correct version since Dart/Flutter is constantly changing. A little bit stressful because I had to redo the entire code, but I got things started.

### Day 8: July 23, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** :Continued a mini project of creating a weather app via DEVSPOT

**Thoughts**: Following the how-to videos is really helping me identify errors/bugs in my code. There are some things I wish I could ask the content creator directly, but I will have to research it independently for the time being.

### Day 9: July 24, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Finished DEVSPOT's weather app tutorial!!!

**Thoughts**: OMFG COMPLETED!!!!! Found some bugs/errors in my code that stopped me from running. But omg, it feels great to finish it and play around with vscode's/flutter's hot reloading feature. Definitley going to clone this codebase and use it to play around with it some more in the future. Also, started super late lol.

### Day 10: July 25, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Back on the tutorials, this time we moved away from DartPad and onto VSCode, which is great because I am know understanding it in a coding environment. The topic is regardin advanced classes. So the meat and potatoes of how classes behave in Dart/Flutter.

### Day 11: July 26, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Today was a serious case of the Mondays, plus a lot of outside distractions kept it hard to focus and concentrate. I did watch a video earlier today called 'Just Build It' by ForestKnight(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L9Ls2gIHts). It was a video essay with advice on how to begin an app project. I'll make that my weekend focus since weekends I don't feel too constrained on time. I'll do better tomorrow.

##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Worked through another tutorial of everything classes with Dart. Completed that section, I do plan on going back and doing some more classes practices. I should get a book, since it seems to help me graps to conecpt better for when I did this with Python.

### Day 13: July 28, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: This time was a mini project on creating an ecommerce site. That was seriously a lot to digest but it was cool with learning how each class talks to each other and how to have your main method produce all of the data from the classes.

### Day 14: July 29, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: Somewhat short section, learned about Mixins and Extensions for Dart. I spent like 20 minutes just playing around with initalizing classes and instantiating them in the main method. Still trying to grasp the concept of classes and all of the meat and potatoes of object-oriented programming. I was not fully there mentally since there were some outside distractions. But tomorrow's learning will be better than todays.

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Dart tutorials by Coding With Andrea

**Thoughts**: So I finished the rest of my troubleshooting. Turns out I had not only a BIOS update, but the 21H1 and a .NET OS update for my machine. Luckily I had a spare macbook that had VSCode and Flutter installed(but not XCode apparently). Oh well, today was a better day than yesterday, I'm almost dobe with the Dart tutorials for Coding with Andrea.

### Day 19: Aug 03, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Played around in VSCode while watching some Flutter basics on Google I/o

**Thoughts**: It started with watching some really really remidial videos on youtube about Flutter(widgets), and I took it upon myself to create another project and kept it simple. By simple, its a basic app that has a list of plants I own. I have an idea on how I want it to look and feel so this will be my first true project. I began googling all types of widgets and how to call them in my code. Only created about 10 lines of code, but I am comprehending this a lot better now.

### Day 20: Aug 04, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued to work on my test app in VSCode

**Thoughts**: Began playing around with Stateless Widgets and add building widgets inside each other and figuring out when to place a new child widget vs children, and proper syntax for each widget. Defintley helping because I am envisioning what I want my app to do, and researching how to bring it to life.

### Day 24: Aug 07, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued widgets ui tutorial

**Thoughts**: Worked on the second half of the basic ui tutorial for Flutter. So far this has been a great help at finding out how to start a project and vizualize each region of an app.

### Day 24: Aug 08, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Started a new Flutter project!

**Thoughts**: I felt lost since I do not know exactly where to start. I keep hearing, ". . . your next step on start a project!". Ok, but how? I feel a lot of these sites give a command but not a how to go with it. I guess this is apart of the experience when learning about coding and whatnot.

### Day 25: Aug 09, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued the StartUp Name project

**Thoughts**: I first started troubleshoting my VSCode since I am still unable to launch apps within an Android emulator. I also need to install an iOS one as well. I think tomorrow I'll take a swing at that. I did try some of the suggestions I read on StackOverflow. After some attempts, no luck. I did continue the name generator project.

### Day 26: Aug 10, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Experimented with the FloatingActionButton

**Thoughts**: So I completed the tutorial, now I am playing around with the code. I found a section in my code block that I wanted to work on, which was the second page that showed the list of names that the user selected. I began researching on what FAB can and cannot do and how to customize it.

### Day 28: Aug 12, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Began working on my first project app

**Thoughts**: I used what I learned about a floatingActionButton and slowly began to make pseudo-code for my app. I think it's best to start working on each "screen" one at a time.

### Day 30: Aug 14, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Worked on login page for app

**Thoughts**: I found a website that shows me how to construct a login page. I know for my first app its going to be a simple plant collection that saves user data based off their login credentials. But I'm feeling pretty demotiavted today, idk if it's the heat or other stuff. I just can't seem to focus and concentrate on this right now.

**Thoughts**: Made some good progress on my plant collection app. I figured out how to adjust the size of the "login" button, also added a "signup" button as well. I did change the logo to reflect the theme of the plant app. Finally, I added some pseudo code for tomorrow with a couple things to do with regards to what I want each button to do. I think I will work on the signup page tomorrow.

##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Finished my signup page!!!!

**Thoughts**: So the goal was to create a signup page and then have the front/login page jump to that when a user taps/clicks "Sign Up". And a HUGE success!!! I even added a back button to return users back to the login screen. Omg so satisfying

### Day 38: Aug 23, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Began working on the "main" page of my app

**Thoughts**: I combed through my code and worked on labeling each block to make it easier for me to navigate each block when working on a specific section. After that, I began to work on the collection page. I didn't have success with BottomNavBar tutorial, so tomorrow I will undo that and go with what I know and use Routes/Navigator. Good thing is that I got the LoginButton to push to the main/collection page =]

### Day 39: Aug 24, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued work on the "main" page of my app

**Thoughts**: I tried using a BottomNavBar method to have a faster way of switching between screens, but that didn't work. For some reason, the app won't launch if I try to implement that method. I then went back to what I know and use onPressed, and no luck either =/   Maybe Flutter only likes one Navigator per app?

### Day 40: Aug 25, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Continued work on the "main" page of my app

### Day 41: Aug 26, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Debugged Settings page

**Thoughts**: Ok, so in order for my app to run with the Navigator.push()... I need to figure out the Null Safety for my app.  I was able to get it to run with the command: flutter run --no-sound-null-safety, which afterward the app launchs(yay). Now the tricky part is figuring out how to resolve the unhandled exception. I did reach out to respond back to my StackOverflow post in hopes to find a solution.

##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Bug Fixes

**Thoughts**: So I gutted my settings and account page of my app, that was the culprit in preventing me from successfully launching without null safety. I will have to rebuild my settings page from the ground up, but I will probably do that one last now.

### Day 46: Aug 31, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Clerical Work/Research

**Thoughts**: I really didn't get to do any coding today, the pain from my back injury has been very disruptive for me. Instead, I created a Dropbox account and began backing up my Flutter_dev folder. I also began watching some videos on "day in the life of an x", just to get an understanding of being a programmer. I also watched some video interviews of individuals who either dropped out of college or didn't attend college, share their success of them landing a programming job. I'll be in a better mindset tomorrow.

### Day 47-51: Sept 1 - 5, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Worked on Settings Page

**Thoughts**: Lately I've been drifing when working on my daily coding. My mind is kind of bouncing around and hard to focus on one single thing. I managed to get some lines of code completed for my app's setting page. But right now, I just can't seem to focus. There's a lot of outside noise that's affecting my attention and motivation right now.

### Day 52: Sept 6, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Working on my Plant app

**Thoughts**: I figured out that I rarely have success with tutorials/how-tos from youtube, yes they're a great reference, but rarely do I have an success replicating their results. Any who, I am pulling everything from Flutter's official site. I found a method of how to create a plant list page and that's a newfound motivation to complete my app. This has been a long process, but I'm figuring out how I overcome problems in my work. I do start school in a couple weeks, not looking forward to that, but it is something I ned to complete in order to move up socioeconomically.

### Day 53: Sept 7, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Working on my Plant app

**Thoughts**: I continued working on the plant list and my settings page. For some reason I am having an issue with getting content to display on my settings page outside of a bottom nav bar ugh!!! Oh well, more progress is better then no progress

### Day 54-57: Sept 8-11, 2021
##### (intentionally left blank)

**Today's Progress** : Resumed Working on my Plant app

**Thoughts**: I feel I am in the middle of a programmers version of a writer's block. I'm stuck with wanting and knowing what to do with my app. I don't know why my settings page is not displaying anything besides the title bar. I can't continue to add plants to the plant list. I know I need to find a way for that page to dynamically list house plants without me manually adding them. I need to add a dark mode switch, and also add a way to authenticate/enroll users using Google. Ugh, I hate being stuck without a clear outline of what needs to be done.
